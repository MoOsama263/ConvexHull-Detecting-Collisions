# ConvexHull-Detecting-Collisions
 Computational Geometry Algoritms
detecting collisions using convex hull algorithms between bodies: Points, Lines, Boxes, Polygons (Concave too), Ellipses and Circles. Also RayCasting. All bodies can have offset, rotation, scale, bounding box padding, can be static (non moving) or be trigger bodies (non colliding).
